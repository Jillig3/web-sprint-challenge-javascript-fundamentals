# Sprint Challenge - JavaScript Fundamentals

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in project. This Sprint explored JavaScript Fundamentals. During this Sprint, you studied array methods, this keyword, prototypes, and class syntax. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by completing a range of JavaScript problems.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. 

## Introduction

The index.js file contains all of your challenges. Please review it in full before answering the questions. If you complete the stretch goals please leave them in your file but commented out so that they do not affect the MVP tasks 

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have all tests passing. You can console.log to check your work and ensure you are submitting the correct results 

### Commits

Set up codegrade early and commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)
Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read.

1. Explain the differences between `.map`, `.reduce` and `.filter` and describe a use case for each. 

.map - converts data and returns it in a brand new array. A good use case would be pulling a specific key value pair from a larger array.
.reduce - returns a single value normally uses addition or multiplication. We can use this to see the population of all the biggest cities together from an array that gives the individual city values.
.filter - filters through data using a boolean. if true then it is added to new array if false it does not go to the new array. We can use this to narrow down arrays for the specific values we want. if we want the largest population cities over 500000 or if we want cities under 100000. We are able to make the argument that best suits our needs.

2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.

Higher Order Functions - A function that receives other functions 
Callback Functions - A function that is passed into another function as an argument

3. Explain what a closure is.

Closure - When the inner function reaches out of its scope to grav a variable defined in an outer funciton

4. Describe the four principles of the 'this' keyword.

Window binding - this has no context so it returns the window
implicit binding - Applies to objects with methods. when the function is invoked look to the left of the dot.
Explicit binding - We explicitly tell the function what the 'this' keyword refers to. Uses .call, .apply or .bin 
New binding - When a function is invoked with a new keyword the this keyword inside that function is bound to the new object being constructed. When a function is invoked as a constructor function using the new keyword, this points to the new object that’s create.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

Using VSCode and Command Line:


1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2: Project Requirements (MVP)

You must complete all tasks inside of `index.js` and answer the questions above.

In your solutions, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.
